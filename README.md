# Real-Time Communication App

## Project Overview
The Real-Time Communication App is a web application designed for seamless video and voice recognition. Built using Node.js, Express, and Socket.IO, it facilitates real-time communication between users through various features like room creation, joining, and transcript sharing.

## Installation
To get started with the Real-Time Communication App, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/real-time-communication-app.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd real-time-communication-app
   ```

3. **Install the dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Start the application:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   The server will run on `http://localhost:8000`.

## Usage
Once the application is running, you can interact with it through a web browser or via a suitable client. Here’s how the core functionalities work:

- **Create a Room:** Users can create a room by sending a request which responds with a unique room ID.
- **Join a Room:** Other users can join existing rooms using the room ID.
- **Share Transcripts:** Users can send and receive transcriptions in real time.

For testing the server’s health, visit:
```
http://localhost:8000/health
```

## Features
- Real-time communication with Socket.IO.
- Room management with unique IDs for each room.
- Transcript sharing among users within the same room.
- CORS-enabled API for cross-origin requests.

## Dependencies
The project relies on several Node.js packages, as defined in the `package.json` file:

- `express`: ^4.21.2 
- `cors`: ^2.8.5 
- `socket.io`: ^4.8.1 
- `uuid`: ^9.0.1 

These modules help in API handling, real-time event handling, cross-origin resource sharing, and generating unique room IDs.

## Project Structure
The project structure is as follows:

```
real-time-communication-app/
│
├── public/                   # Static files served to the client
│
├── package.json              # Project metadata and dependencies
├── package-lock.json         # Exact versions of dependencies
└── server.js                 # Main server file
```

### Explanation of Key Files
- **server.js**: Contains the core application logic for handling connections, rooms, message broadcasting, and user disconnections.
- **package.json**: Configuration file that includes scripts and package dependencies.
- **public/**: Directory reserved for static files that are served to the client.

## Conclusion
The Real-Time Communication App provides a robust platform for users to engage in real-time communication effectively. Modify and extend the application as needed to meet your specific requirements.
